  The IoT-based gas leakage detection system aims to enhance safety by detecting hazardous gas levels (LPG/methane) in real-time using an MQ-2 sensor interfaced with an ESP32 microcontroller.         The system publishes gas concentration data via MQTT to a Python-based web dashboard, which displays live readings, logs historical data, and issues alerts (via buzzer, dashboard, or optional email) when dangerous thresholds are exceeded. The dual-ESP32 architecture separates sensing and control functions, ensuring modularity and scalability for household or industrial applications
